        <h1>Colossus</h1>
        <p>Colossus is a game made for the 7DFPS game jam held on 8 to 15 November 2014. An initiative for creating interesting and new first person shooter games. Since the genre is somewhat stagnating. We decided to focus on platforming and boss battles. Since we felt that this is a field where fps games can improve.</p>
        <p>Inspired by Shadow of the Colossus and Metroid Prime, we created a first person shooter focused on exploration, boss battles and platforming. Battle giants, explore dungeons and find your way through the sandstorm. Expected play time: 2 hours.</p>
        <h2>Story</h2>
        <p>An ancient warrior awoken from his eternal slumber is disoriented by his past, his future and his purpose. Guided by red flags in a thick sand storm he finds his rest. Giant statues of ancient glory and a long lost power are fond between the dunes. He knows only one thing, he must defeat the great evil that is bestowed upon these gigantic creatures.</p>
        <h2>Game play</h2>
        <p>Follow the red flags and see where your journey leads you.</p>
        <p>Controls: &#9;<i class="fa fa-keyboard-o"></i> <i class="fa fa-mouse-pointer"></i></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Look around with your mouse</li>
          <li>Shoot with your left mouse button</li>
          <li>Press space to jump</li>
          <li>Use W A S and D to walk around or use the arrow keys</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you are lost among the dues, you will be brought back to the last flag. Note that your orientation might be changed during the teleportation process.</p>
        
        <h2>Download</h2>
        <p>The downloads are available for multiple platforms and WebGL. The binary executables are all in <i class="fa fa-file-archive-o"></i>.zip format. Extract the archive and run the executable. Controls are rebindable in the launcher.</p>
